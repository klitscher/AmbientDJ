## Features

### Simple setup

The only thing you need to do as a user is give us the location of your music library. AmbientDJ will do the rest! To make it even simpler, we prompt you for this the first time you run our program. After that, you never need to worry about it again!

### Exclude moods you don't want to hear

We provide you the flexability to be a god of moods. Our user's feel the true power of binary choice: `left click` a mood to only play songs that include that mood. `right click` a mood to only play songs that exclude that mood. Mix and match to play songs that include some moods but not others!

| Include Mood | Exclude Mood | Mood Combo |
